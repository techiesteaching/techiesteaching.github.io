									<article>Hi, my name is Nathan Bocanegra and I am 20 years old. I am a very open minded person who likes trying new things and meeting new people. I am currently a student at Year Up Chicago. Some things I like to do is watch and study films, paint, draw, write and play sports such as baseball and basketball. Before I started this program and learned skills in hardware, software, and programming, I worked for Target, Family Dollar and as a waiter but these jobs never really pushed me to reach my potential.
									<br>
									<br>
									I went to college pursuing a degree in graphic design but sometimes things don’t go your way and paths change. I came into Year Up looking to get into a great career. IT is a great field to get into and I knew companies will need jobs to fill. The only knowledge I had about computers was from my own practice and just me messing around with different programs. I really enjoy web development and the concept of creating something and making it unique. I am always looking for ways to be in innovative and I am always looking around for inspiration. Aside from web development, computer hardware is another track I am getting better in and will pursue the CompTIA A+ certification and CCNA certification. One of my first goals is to excel in my internship and utilize the skills I have learned and be successful moving forward. </article>

									<article>Let’s roll back about 5 years. The culmination of high school was fast approaching and I was confused about where life was going to take me. Having just received my ACT scores, I knew a 28 was good enough to get into say, Harvard, but my grades were not reflective of my intelligence or potential. My peers, mentors, teachers, and other influential figures in my life kept telling me that I would become something and was a force to reckoned with. Although aware of my own shortcomings, unbeknownst to me was a new beginning to reflect and understand my purpose and potential in the coming chapter of my life.
									<br>
									While in limbo between an unfinished high school diploma and the prospect of being able to attend college, Hampton University offered me a Presidential Scholarship to flourish at their “Home By The Sea.” I took the opportunity with open arms and welcomed a new beginning despite a lack of resolve from the previous chapter. Two years into a mathematics degree I returned to Chicago, downtrodden and tired, but still willing, and hungry. I don’t think I would be walking the current path if I hadn’t strayed from the previous one on which I had been set.
									<br>
									I was hungry to learn and needed a teacher. After working for a few big name box stores and a corporate umbrella I realized I dove in too early and hadn’t gotten swimming lessons yet. So, I backtracked to what I knew and returned to school. I had the ability to retract back in my book and finish my last semester of high school to receive an official Diploma. Upon completion, I enrolled in Olive Harvey Community College to fill in a few classes before entering a 4-year university. In tandem to continuing my education, I was looking for an internship to gain experience. Just in the nick of time, I received an opportunity to participate in Year Up, an IT workforce-training program where I’ve gained knowledge and skills in hardware, software, web development, and business communication to aid my journey in the corporate workforce.

								<article>Zig Ziglar once said, “Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations. The best is yet to come.” With that in mind, I moved to the United States about six years ago from Bangladesh without having various experiences such as speaking different language. Now that I look back, it really feels that coming here was like choosing a difficult path since I did not know anyone here nor I could speak the language, however, it was the gateway to all the beautiful destinations to fulfill my dreams and goals, and this is just the beginning of all.
								<br>
								Hello! My name is Sadiya , and I have six sisters! SIX SISTERS? I know how it sounds, but I love spending time with all of them. I am very proud to have each one of them in my life. We have a lot of fun watching movies, travelling to different places, and hanging out by the beach together. As for high school, I went to Senn High School, and after graduating from there, I attended Northeastern Illinois University to complete my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Finance. When I was about to start my third year in college, one of my friends told me about Year Up, and I thought why not give it a chance since the program was a really good idea to gain a professional career.
								<br>
								I am hoping to become one of the most successful Cyber Security analysts within next 2-3 years. After graduating from Year Up, I will be finishing up my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Finance while working full-time in IT. I am also planning to get my MBA and Ph.D. in Mathematics after my bachelor’s degree. I would like to get a Ph.D. in Mathematics because I love Math, and it has been my favorite subject since I was in kindergarten. I used to be a Math tutor for my sisters, in school, and in college. As for long-term goals, I will be building my own global business in the IT industry in next 8-10 years, which will also give me the opportunity to travel all around the world.
